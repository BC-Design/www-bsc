(12:31:18 AM) BC: if you're bored, let me know if this (and/or its print preview) looks terrible in your OS/browser combo https://www.brandoncurtis.com/resume
(12:32:31 AM) BC: (needs some updates to be 100% factual; was updated when I was feeling more optimistic about where I'd be by now)
(10:18:28 AM) Carly Anderson: https://plus.google.com/photos/albums/pqr4q8s33ktftpriistj5qjt7cdlq62q3?pid=6347308428162502610&oid=101030012104678031088
(10:18:38 AM) BC: *click
(10:18:41 AM) Carly Anderson: at first glance, does not look terrible! (:
(10:19:07 AM) BC: oh good, it's using (more-or-less) the fonts I specified
(10:19:09 AM) BC: danke!
(10:20:18 AM) Carly Anderson: for the Info Tech and SCC... can you add the research network? it seems a little sketchy that it's not defined
(10:20:47 AM) Carly Anderson: i'm guessing you're talking about curtis lab and don't want to use the last name (;
(10:21:13 AM) Carly Anderson: but as written, it implies berkeley and better it be stated in your resume than during an interview
(10:21:24 AM) Carly Anderson: / you could use that same title for graves lab
(10:21:41 AM) Carly Anderson: so you could say Curtis and Graves Labs
(10:21:47 AM) BC: that's right, I also run the IT for the university fellowship office and a couple other places
(10:22:01 AM) Carly Anderson: dude, mention that!!!
(10:22:29 AM) Carly Anderson: it's a good example of starting simple and building your skills / taking on more and more responsibility
(10:23:12 AM) BC: I was technically an intern for a while.  And on the side I've built about a hundred desktops and servers and I'm running a bunch of servers and web apps for a bunch of different organizations
(10:23:16 AM) BC: feedback appreciated
(10:23:40 AM) BC: it's like, hmmm, I should probably mention this, so my thought was to lump all of that into a single line item
(10:23:42 AM) Carly Anderson: i really like your layout, and the subject matter expertise section
(10:24:07 AM) Carly Anderson: yeah, but more specifics would be good. i think you can do that with just one more line
(10:24:46 AM) BC: :thumbsup:
(10:24:55 AM) Carly Anderson: i don't think you need to list the FE. it's not relevant since you will have a PhD
(10:25:09 AM) Carly Anderson: honestly, i think you could remove that to save space
(10:25:14 AM) Carly Anderson: the whole prof cert thing
(10:25:30 AM) BC: I wavered on that, but then at the infosession they talked about how they'd pay for you to study and take that
(10:25:48 AM) Carly Anderson: but you don't need to take the FE to take the PE as a PhD
(10:25:58 AM) Carly Anderson: so it adds no value
(10:26:03 AM) BC: really?
(10:26:08 AM) Carly Anderson: yup
(10:26:13 AM) Carly Anderson: i took the FE too
(10:26:20 AM) Carly Anderson: and now regret the 3 hrs i spent studying for it  :-P
(10:26:57 AM) Carly Anderson: and i think radio license is a given if you're into electronics, / doesn't actually take that much time to study for. you could mention it as an interest or hobby
(10:27:15 AM) Carly Anderson: at least pretty sure... checking
(10:27:53 AM) BC: that's mostly in there as a dog whistle for other communications people :p
(10:28:21 AM) BC: there are actually a lot of dog whistles in there... should add more...
(10:29:30 AM) Carly Anderson: nope. i think focusing on quantitative stuff is better.
(10:29:41 AM) Carly Anderson: the person reading it is going to HR, not communications
(10:29:48 AM) Carly Anderson: they don't give a f*(** what your call sign is
(10:30:16 AM) Carly Anderson: confirmed. in CA, if you have a Board Approved Doctorate in Engineering you do not need to pass the FE for PE
(10:30:24 AM) Carly Anderson: http://www.bpelsg.ca.gov/applicants/faq_eng.pdf
(10:30:27 AM) Carly Anderson: see question 3f
(10:30:40 AM) BC: it appears to vary state-by-state
(10:30:51 AM) BC: I'm reading a totally different set of rules for TX
(10:30:53 AM) Carly Anderson: i just remember that being true for VA as well
(10:31:15 AM) BC: qualify for an EIT waiver with an ABET-accredited engineering BS degree and 15+ years of "qualifying work experience"
(10:31:16 AM) BC: lol
(10:31:49 AM) Carly Anderson: dumb comment: switch Berkeley CA and University of... in the first entry in Research Exp
(10:31:54 AM) Carly Anderson: it's currently inconsistent 
(10:32:05 AM) Carly Anderson: with the structure for the rest of it
(10:32:28 AM) Carly Anderson: are you technically co-advised with graves / Clark?
(10:32:30 AM) BC: in the Exponent case, I don't think it'll be HR—they at least made the impression that resumes go straight to the teams
(10:32:36 AM) BC: right... I guess I am...
(10:34:09 AM) Carly Anderson: do you have any first-author pubs from undergrad?
(10:34:16 AM) Carly Anderson: it's weird you don't have a pubs section
(10:34:24 AM) BC: I don't?  I should
(10:34:28 AM) Carly Anderson: the other section you could consider is "leadership"
(10:34:36 AM) Carly Anderson: you could make the teaching experience section smaller
(10:35:15 AM) Carly Anderson: ohhhh interesting
(10:35:22 AM) Carly Anderson: it doesn't show up in the browser
(10:35:27 AM) Carly Anderson: but when i go to print, everything changes
(10:35:41 AM) BC: try ctrl-f5 to drop the page cache
(10:35:57 AM) BC: hmm. should look at this in a couple different browsers
(10:35:58 AM) Carly Anderson: doesn't fix it
(10:36:12 AM) Carly Anderson: it stops at teaching experience. i zoomed out. sending screenshot
(10:36:34 AM) Carly Anderson: https://plus.google.com/photos/albums/pqr4q8s33ktftpriistj5qjt7cdlq62q3?pid=6347313097279048818&oid=101030012104678031088
(10:36:38 AM) Carly Anderson: will print as pdf and send it over
(10:36:51 AM) BC: should go:
certs
awards
pubs
research
teaching
(10:37:19 AM) BC: pubs is in there.  Ultra-compressed because nobody cares
(10:37:25 AM) Carly Anderson: weirdly enough, it shows up when i go to print but not in browser
(10:38:20 AM) Carly Anderson: no but i swear, it's not there
(10:38:26 AM) Carly Anderson: in the online version
(10:38:38 AM) Carly Anderson: just fyi
(10:38:50 AM) BC: okay, will look into it
(10:40:07 AM) BC: oh wow, I forgot the education section
(10:40:11 AM) BC: oops
(10:40:18 AM) Carly Anderson: cool. i would take out the prof. certs. i don't think it adds much of anything, and then honors/awards would fit the first page
(10:40:37 AM) BC: (I'm transcribing from an old Google Docs template that I've been updating for years)
(10:41:01 AM) Carly Anderson: you should also list authors on the papers
(10:41:09 AM) BC: I enjoy pain so I wanted it to be native HTML, but use a separate stylesheet to print more-or-less consistently (in a slightly different format)
(10:41:31 AM) Carly Anderson: (i.e. where you fall) some people care about that, and it currently looks like you might be trying to make yourself look more impressiver
(10:41:33 AM) Carly Anderson: *e
(10:41:47 AM) Carly Anderson: which is the point but you're supposed to be more subtle?
(10:42:04 AM) BC: I really don't want pubs to take up more than one line each, but I'll think about it
(10:42:29 AM) Carly Anderson: oh interesting. so the pubs and honors sections are the only ones that don't render in the browser. 
(10:42:40 AM) Carly Anderson: just write "Curtis, et al."
(10:42:52 AM) Carly Anderson: or "XXX, B. Curtis, et al.
(10:43:01 AM) Carly Anderson: you don't need to put all of them
(10:43:12 AM) BC: I requested DOI shortlinks because I didn't even want to use the full DOI, lol
(10:43:39 AM) Carly Anderson: you still have half a page
(10:43:44 AM) Carly Anderson: in print version
(10:43:53 AM) Carly Anderson: so that's not even a good excuse
(10:44:36 AM) Carly Anderson: well, a couple of lines anyway. and if you can fix the way the section titles look when printed, that would be nice? they look like they're not doing exactly what you wan
(10:44:38 AM) Carly Anderson: *t
(10:45:00 AM) BC: there are a bunch of non-research technical documents that I've published online that have approached a quarter-million views each, was debating someone highlighting them
(10:45:01 AM) Carly Anderson: overall, looks real good though (:
(10:45:03 AM) Carly Anderson: i'd hire you.
(10:45:10 AM) Carly Anderson: go for it
(10:45:12 AM) BC: lol! thanks for the feedback
(10:45:28 AM) BC: I love when IOP is like "congrats!  100 people downloaded your paper!"
(10:45:31 AM) BC: and it's like.... ......
(10:45:38 AM) Carly Anderson: hahahaha
(10:45:49 AM) Carly Anderson: sending resume / cover letter to exponent this weekend?
(10:45:54 AM) Carly Anderson: / by monday?
(10:46:03 AM) BC: yeah, was going to shoot for early Monday morning
(10:46:09 AM) Carly Anderson: awesome (: (: (:
(10:46:11 AM) BC: cover letter is... blah
(10:46:15 AM) Carly Anderson: good work sir.
(10:46:19 AM) Carly Anderson: yeah cover letters suck
(10:46:28 AM) Carly Anderson: melanie has given me the best advice on them, i think 
(10:46:38 AM) Carly Anderson: so at least you have a good in-house consultant
(10:46:41 AM) BC: I should look at more examples and ask her
(10:46:51 AM) Carly Anderson: i kept not giving concete-enough examples
(10:47:05 AM) Carly Anderson: yeah. i can send you one of mine if you want
(10:47:11 AM) Carly Anderson: they are super cheesy and embarrasing though
(10:47:24 AM) Carly Anderson: mahati's stuff was also really good
(10:47:26 AM) BC: I would appreciate that
(10:47:38 AM) Carly Anderson: well at least her resume
(10:47:45 AM) Carly Anderson: cool
(10:47:58 AM) Carly Anderson: let me see what i have. will send over in a sec
(10:48:29 AM) Carly Anderson: god, the 2016JobSearch folder is getting out of control...
