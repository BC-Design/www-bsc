They are the undisputed kings of heavy metal and responsible for bringing the art form into the homes of millions around the world. Nobody sought them out, they forced their way in and continue to be an unstoppable monster of sound and energy to this day. Their songs are anthems in NFL and major sports stadiums across the country.\u00a0 They've won Grammy's, they've headlined every festival around the globe from Glastonbury to Lollapalooza. They've sold over 110 million records worldwide and have a consecutive streak of #1 chart debuting albums that spans their last five full length releases. They were first ballot Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. Quite frankly, there's nothing they haven't done or accomplished which is why it is with zero trepidation that I make the bold statement that it is absolutely stupefying that these American pioneers of rock have not been involved with a Super Bowl halftime to date and it is time for that to change. Super Bowl 50, the biggest of all Super Bowls, just happens to be taking place in the home region (Northern California, San Francisco Bay area) of one of America's biggest and most legendary rock acts. The connection needs to happen, Metallica needs to be the musical act for Super Bowl 50.\u00a0 It's time. It's time for the sugar-pop and candy artists to step aside in favor of real American metal. It's time to put a band (you know, one that actually plays instruments and does it well) on the field and let them plug in and do their thing. We don't need pop-tarts on mechanical tigers giving us flash and no substance, we need amps and drums cranked up and played with power and emotion. It's time. Give America what it wants and needs. Metallica will not let you down. I guarantee it. \u00a0","fallback":"Change.org: National Football League: Ask Metallica to be the musical act for the halftime of Super Bowl 50","thumb_url":"http:\/\/d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net\/photos\/9\/vo\/ts\/UrvotSJIynogGIb-1600x900-noPad.jpg","from_url":"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/national-football-league-ask-metallica-to-be-the-musical-act-for-the-halftime-of-super-bowl-50","thumb_width":1024,"thumb_height":576,"id":1}],"ts":"1443598521.000021"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6T0LNT","text":"...the big picture.","ts":"1443598537.000023"},{"type":"message","user":"U0AVA8KDH","text":"Didn't really fit anywhere else, so figured I'd ask here while I try to Google in parallel.
