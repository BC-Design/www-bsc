In other words, it's effectively impossible for this to happen.<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","lines":3,"lines_more":0,"channels":["C0A6T3YHY"],"groups":[],"ims":[],"comments_count":1,"initial_comment":{"id":"Fc0DB1S6AJ","created":1446014111,"timestamp":1446014111,"user":"U0A6T0LNT","comment":"This looks promising!"}},"user":"U0A6T0LNT","upload":true,"display_as_bot":false,"username":"<@U0A6T0LNT|brandon>","bot_id":null,"ts":"1446014111.000184"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6T0LNT","text":"as <@U0BRLU4PL> mentioned, it looks like Armory supports multisig \"lockboxes\" (arbitrary m-of-n transaction vault implementation) as well:\n\"A board of three directors maintaining funds for their organization \u2014 those funds cannot be spent unless any two of those directors agrees.

This effectively limits you to 15 of 15 multisig (7 of 7 if using uncompressed keys).  See 520 byte limit. For the tx to be \"Standard\" the ScriptSig must be less than 500 bytes so that limits you to 7 signatures (i.e. 7 of 15 or 7 of 7).  A larger \"m\" (i.e. 8 of 15) is still valid but it isn't standard and won't be relayed by most nodes.\"\n<https:\/\/bitcoin.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23893\/what-are-the-limits-of-m-and-n-in-m-of-n-multisig-addresses\/28104#28104>","attachments":[{"title":"What are the limits of m and n in m-of-n multisig addresses?","title_link":"https:\/\/bitcoin.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23893\/what-are-the-limits-of-m-and-n-in-m-of-n-multisig-addresses\/28104#28104","text":"This method describes how to create a 2-of-3 multisig.
