You mentioned teaching.  I know a good handful of faculty members who DO care about teaching-- they care about it a lot.  And they're not just lecturers, or faculty at teaching colleges (though some are).  But they're not treated with professional disdain-- they're some of the most respected people in their fields.  And these types of people are becoming more and more common. True, right now they're a small minority.  But twenty years ago, they were a SUPER TINY minority.  There are whole journals and conferences-- active ones!-- dedicated to pedagogy research that didn't exist even ten years ago.  I can even see the difference over my five years in grad school: going to the same conference for four years in a row, the number of sessions and panels that are specifically focused on engineering education have more than doubled.","ts":"1446772748.000044"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6WE73P","text":"So it's not really fair to equate \"caring about teaching\" with \"not respected.\"  Focusing on research to the detriment of teaching is obviously still widespread and a problem, but to say we're not making progress is absurd.","ts":"1446772815.000045"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6WE73P","text":"I have noticed that biologists tend to care a lot more about teaching than engineers, so maybe my perspective is different because I rarely work with people who are \"pure\" engineers.","ts":"1446772926.000046"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6WE73P","text":"and you mentioned politics-- this week there was a great example of \"make-it-to-the-top-and-then-effect-change\" with Trudeau's cabinet appointments in Canada","ts":"1446773167.000047"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6WE73P","text":"pretty dramatic","ts":"1446773176.000048"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6WE73P","text":"Norway did a similar thing in the 80s-- their first female prime minister had a cabinet that was 40% female (big shift at the time), and gender parity was way better off in their government even after she left","ts":"1446773288.000049"}]
