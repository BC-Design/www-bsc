It's a lot of fun to work with, and it's nice to see what goes on under the hood. I'm currently developing an interface condition between different domains that will hopefully go into the Moose framework. Trying to develop within the framework has made me realize how elegant and concise their code is.","ts":"1446732902.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0B061R88","text":"<@U0A6V6PHS>: What type of math stuff do you do?","ts":"1446732921.000003"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6V6PHS","text":"Algebraic and combinatorial theory of splines, i.e. differentiable piecewise polynomial approximation functions, and partition functions, i.e. the ones from statistical mechanics.","ts":"1446733479.000004"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6V6PHS","text":"In particular, I know things about vector spaces of polynomials that represent the local structure of special classes of piecewise polynomial functions.","ts":"1446733629.000005"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6V6PHS","text":"I don't know how much math you know, so I don't know if any of that made sense to you.","ts":"1446733676.000006"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6WE73P","text":"<@U0A6XP8JF> <@U0A6V6PHS> <@U0A6T0LNT> Have been processing all you guys have been saying re: awesome open software tools, and feeling a little bit like a kid looking into the window of a candy store.  <@U0A6XP8JF> says the best way to take the plunge is to start running Linux full-time (and judging by what <@U0B061R88> has been saying, that's a good approach to take).
