Basic breakdown:\n\nYou pay in to add meal points onto your card. For grad students, you get a bonus 10% for whatever reason. The year is divided up into academic year ~August-May, and summer, ~May-August. Points \"expire\" at these transitions.\n\nStarting fresh, there is a $200 buy-in (which gets you 220 points). Meals are as follows:\nBreakfast: 6\nLunch \/ Brunch: 7\nDinner: 8\n\nYou _can_ eat for cheaper, especially if you cook, but here's why I get so much value out of it.\n1) I eat A LOT. So the 4 all you can eat locations within 2-10 mins walking of Tan are GREAT.\n2) I love the variety \/ selection. There are some things served everyday (e.g. a fantastic salad bar stocked with lots of organic and local goodies, pizza, some kind of pasta almost always, etc.) along with a large selection of rotating items. Check out the daily menu for a sample of the typical rotating entree offerings: <http:\/\/services.housing.berkeley.edu\/FoodPro\/dining\/static\/todaysentrees.asp>\n3) I spend *0* time\/effort planning menus, buying groceries, cooking, cleaning up, storing, or hauling food. Some of these things I do enjoy (e.g. planning menus, cooking), but in the grand scheme of time savings, pretty much can't be beat. This is perhaps the biggest advantage.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, my ideal day consists of getting to lab early, starting experiments up, setting off for my run around 8:30 or 9 (depending on how much mileage I'm after), arriving back for the approximate opening of brunch at my favorite location, Cafe 3, at 10 AM, eating, showing at Tan, resuming lab work until 6-7, then going and eating dinner. If you count the +10% points for paying in as an ~9% discount instead, that means I'm spending $13.65 a day on food. Each meal does include the option of taking out a piece of fruit for a later snack, though I don't usually take advantage of that.\n\nI realize that's not the cheapest and, health-wise, it'd probably be better to eat more, smaller meals throughout the day, but this seems to be a pretty good optimum for me right now in terms of time\/money trade-offs (not mentioned above is that my roommates do not do a good job of keeping the kitchen up to my standard of clean and ready to go ... if they did, and I didn't have to clean everything up before being able to even start cooking, I would include a lot more home cooking in my diet (e.g. healthy staples like rice + beans + vegetables) to greatly lower my daily costs without incurring too much time penalty).","ts":"1445211308.000067"},{"type":"message","user":"U0A6T0LNT","text":"<@U0A6V6PHS>, thoughts?
