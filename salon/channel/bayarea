Moderator: Andy Crane, Professor of Business Ethics, Policy, and Strategy at Schulich School of Business Date &amp; Time: Thursday, December 3rd, 2015 from 12:15-1:30PM <em>Talk starts at 12:30PM</em> Location: Haas School of Business, Wells Fargo Room (C420) Food: Lunch will be served to registered attendees Companies:            About the event: An increasing number of business are choosing to organize in structures not traditional seen in for-profit business, which offer opportunities for them to blur the boundaries between the public, private, and non-profit sectors and achieve greater social impact. These organizations can also be defined as hybrid organizations, enterprises that design their business models based on the alleviation of a particular social or environmental issue, including many benefit corporations (B-Corps) and cooperatives. Hybrid organizations offer an innovative new approach to capitalism and an alternative structure for organizations with goals that extend beyond short-term profits. The B-Corp certification began in 2007 and now includes over 1,300 businesses from 41 countries and over 121 industries. B-Corps and many hybrid organizations pledge to meet stringent social and environmental standards, and acknowledge that long-term sustainability relies on accounting for stakeholder interests. In this session we will explore how the growth of hybrid organizations offers solutions to social and environmental challenges, and what power they have in creating a more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable society. Key questions: Would widespread adoption of hybrid organizations transform capitalism? How strict or loose are the sustainability and responsible business requirements for becoming a B-Corp or a hybrid organization? Is the movement towards alternative forms of organization part of a shift of corporations towards increased sustainability and social responsibility? About the speakers: From Left: Bruce Lymburn, Vincent Stanley, and Andrew Crane Bruce Lymburn is General Counsel and Secretary Clif Bar &amp; Company.  Bruce Lymburn serves as general counsel, secretary and director for Clif Bar &amp; Company, where he is extensively involved in the legal and business affairs of the company. With our own Prof. Richard Buxbaum, he developed a corporate governance structure and articles of incorporation that allowed Clif Bar &amp; Company to pursue multiple aspirational “bottom lines” (business, community, environment, etc.). Lymburn will draw from his personal experiences to provide an in-house perspective on the operating and legal challenges faced by a successful and fast-growing business with multiple goals.  For many years, Bruce has also been a mediator and arbitrator on the Alameda County Alternative Dispute Resolution Panel.  Bruce received his B.A. from the UC Santa Cruz and his J.D. from the UC Berkeley School of Law.  Vincent Stanley, co-author with Yvon Chouinard of The Responsible Company, has been with Patagonia on and off since its beginning in 1973, for many of those years in key executive roles as head of sales or marketing. More informally, he is Patagonia’s long-time chief storyteller. Vincent helped develop the Footprint Chronicles, the company’s interactive website that outlines the social and environmental impact of its products; the Common Threads Partnership; and Patagonia Books. He currently serves as the company’s Director, Patagonia Philosophy, and is a visiting fellow at the Yale School of Management. He is also a poet whose work has appeared in Best American Poetry. He and his wife, the writer Nora Gallagher, live in Santa Barbara. Andrew Crane is currently the George R. Gardiner Professor of Business Ethics at The Schulich School of Business, York University.  His research and teaching explore new ways of thinking about the social, ethical and environmental dimensions of business. He is particularly known for his work on the changing role of the corporation in the global economy, where he has been influential in developing a new view of corporate citizenship that addresses the political roles and responsibilities of business. He has also focused on how ideas of ethics, freedom, and responsibility are communicated and made meaningful by corporations, consumers and other stakeholders through talk and text. Finally, his work has also addressed specific application areas of corporate responsibility, such as forced labour and slavery, competitive intelligence, responsible marketing, nonprofit partnerships, and responsibilities to children.  Event hosts: This event is produced by the Center for Responsible Business, California Management Review, and Cooperatives at Cal.      About the Peterson Series: The Peterson Series is the Center for Responsible Business’ flagship speaker series. It convenes future business innovators, forward-thinking academics, and distinguished business leaders to discuss and move us forward toward a sustainable future. Each semester Peterson Series events explore emerging areas requiring vision and leadership from Berkeley-Haas MBA students, corporate partners, and faculty members. The Peterson Series is an embodiment of the man it is named for, Rudolph Peterson (1904-2003): bold, forward-thinking, and possessing a resolute view that businesses should be productive and ethical contributors to society. About California Management Review: California Management Review is the University of California's leading academic business journal, serving as a bridge of communication between those who study management and those who practice it. As one of the most frequently cited management publications globally, CMR is used by the Financial Times to assess faculty research productivity at business schools. The journal's recent special issue on hybrid organizations is the most comprehensive collection of articles published on the subject to date, and features research on the managerial, strategic, and policy-level implications of this emergent form of business. To learn more about hybrid organizations, visit California Management Review online. About Cooperatives at Cal: Cooperatives at Cal is a group of students and community leaders committed to cooperative business’ potential to effect social, economic, and environmental change. Our main platform is our student-taught course, Cooperatives: Alternative Business Models for a Resilient Economy. We also tour the country hosting workshops on the creation of coop educational spaces and advocate for institutionalization of cooperative business curriculum in higher ed.

The rep from Patagonia couldn't make it, so it was the moderator, a Berkeley professor that studies hybrid organizations, and the guy from Clif bar. Not a whole lot of really stimulating conversation, but I did pick up some media recommendations:<br />Moderator recommended this Youtube video on in answer to a question about consumer and company motivation:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc</a><br />The book "One Report" in answer to a question about metrics for integrating social / environmental benefit into evaluations.<br />The book "Market for Virtue" written by Berkeley prof David Vogel on social responsibility in capitalism.<br />Also, they gave out free copies of the California Management Review special issue on hybrid organizations. I grabbed one, and can pass it to @brandon tonight at lab meeting if he's interested.</div>

The teens, both 17 years old, were presumed drowned after rescue teams from the U.S. Coast Guard and San Francisco Fire Department failed to find them in an extensive search of the Ocean Beach area that included air, land and sea crews for almost five hours, officials said. The boys, whose names were not released, had run into the surf wearing swim trunks, their arms linked with those of three friends, witnesses said. The search for the other two, described by their friends as weak swimmers, was called off at 9 p.m. after investigating agencies told the boys’ families they had probably drowned. The Coast Guard had dispatched two 47-foot motorized lifeboats and a helicopter to search for the boys, while the San Francisco Fire Department dispatched air- and water-rescue teams, along with people to sweep the length of shoreline.</div>
